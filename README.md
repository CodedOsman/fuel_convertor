This project was built using python and Tkinter library.
This is a fun project to convert amount of cash to liters of fuel.

Makes use of a currency convertor API  to convert predefined currencies to USD according to live rates, 
then uses the obtained conversion to calculate the current liters of fuel you could get with the current rate.

This project would be updated in the future to enable calculations based on locations and allow for possible addition of fuel stands
for variety.
